# NOTE:
# - This file lists third-party packages that are imported by the server source.
# - Several entries (Vertex AI, moviepy, whisper, etc.) are heavy and can cause
#   build-time OOM on constrained platforms (e.g. Vercel). If you want a
#   lightweight build for Vercel, tell me and I will produce a minimal
#   `requirements.txt` and update server code to lazy-import/guard heavy libs.
